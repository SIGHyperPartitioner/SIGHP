## Response 
Q:  
Figure 1(c) serves as the basis for the contribution of this paper, but the description of it in Section 1 is too brief and unclear. Therefore, I suggest you provide a more comprehensive description of Figure 1(c) from various aspects to strengthen your motivation further

A:  
According to reviewer’s suggestion, we have added more descriptions about Figure 1© and emphasized the connection between information theory and graph partitioning in three additional places to better motivate the paper’s proposal.
