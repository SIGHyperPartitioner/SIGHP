Q:  
I seriously doubt the rationality of Equation (5). Is it reasonable to assume that events (v \in e) and (v' \in e) are independent? You should provide a theoretical or intuitive explanation. Please note that the explanation of this point is crucial as it determines the validity of your theory.

A:  
Heuristic algorithms in data mining often make assumptions to simplify complex problems and to focus on practical solutions that work well in practice, even if they are not perfect. For example, decision tree algorithms utilizing entropy and information gains, e.g., ID3, C4.5, and CART, also make assumptions about the decision paths and boundaries, e.g., independence of features at different tree levels.   
We totally agree that evaluating assumptions of a heuristic algorithm is important to ensure they are reasonable and to understand their impact on the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness. To validate the assumption, we analyze the GH dataset, by calculating the Jarcard index between hyperedges. We found that in most cases, the Jaccard index ranged between 0 and 0.05, indicating that the similarity between most hyperedges is not significant. We also calculated the conditional probability P(AB) / (P(A) * P(B)), reaching a similar conclusion. It was noted that the majority of the hyperedges exhibit low correlation. More experiments and statistics are available at the following Supporting Materials.

## Revision


We conducted a correlation analysis on the GitHub dataset, randomly selecting any two hyperedges to calculate the correlation and Jaccard similarity between them. The results indicate that the vast majority of hyperedges has weak correlation or similarity between them.
