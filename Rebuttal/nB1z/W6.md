## Response
Q:  
Clarifying the intuition behind the hyperedge-cut (HC) in Eq. (2) could improve readability.

A:  
Thanks for your suggestion. We have given a detailed example for  How to calculate partition quality metric HC and $\lambda_{HC}$ in Appendix A2. We hope it can help you and the later reader to better understand these metrics.
