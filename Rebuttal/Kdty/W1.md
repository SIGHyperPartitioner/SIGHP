## Response 
Q:  
Def 3 seems to be capture the shared information between a vertex and a partition by looking at the hyperedges each cover, so it makes sense. But lhs of Eq 6 is wrong, the things inside I_M() are not probabilities. The same issue appears in all the uses of I_M (It may make more sense to call it "mutual information"). Also, Eq 5 is not entirely clear; those two events (that you multiply) may not be independent, or calling it a conditional probability is misleading from the start.  

A:  
We apologize for the confusion regarding Eq. 4 and Eq. 6, caused by the use of symbols $I$（which always used to represent the mutual information）. We have replaced the representation of $I$ with $\mathbb{I}$. The inside things $A|B$ represents the conditional probability of event B given the occurrence of event A rather than the mutual information.  
We provide the following explanation to address the reviewer's confusion about independence:  
Heuristic algorithms in data mining often make assumptions to simplify complex problems and to focus on practical solutions that work well in practice, even if they are not perfect. For example, decision tree algorithms utilizing entropy and information gains, e.g., ID3, C4.5, and CART, also make assumptions about the decision paths and boundaries, e.g., independence of features at different tree levels.   
We totally agree that evaluating assumptions of a heuristic algorithm is important to ensure they are reasonable and to understand their impact on the algorithm’s effectiveness. To validate the assumption, we analyze the GH dataset, by calculating the Jarcard index between hyperedges. We found that in most cases, the Jaccard index ranged between 0 and 0.05, indicating that the similarity between most hyperedges is not significant. We also calculated the conditional probability P(AB) / (P(A) * P(B)), reaching a similar conclusion. It was noted that the majority of the hyperedges exhibit low correlation. More experiments and statistics are available at the following:

## Revision


We have revised the usage of symbols $I$ and $I_M$, replacing them with the symbol $\mathbb{I}$.
