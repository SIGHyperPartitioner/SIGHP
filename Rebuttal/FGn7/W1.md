## Response
Q:  
The definitions in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 are overly concise, resulting in a loss of readability. For example, E_r(v_i) is not strictly defined and requires consultation of other related literature to understand, and Equation (2) is not intuitive.

A:  
We have appended an example of a hypergraph in the appendix to illustrate the relevant concepts in hypergraphs (including $E_r$), and indicated the location of this example in Section 2.


## Reference 
None

## Revision

We have provided a example of hypergraph for a better understanding for reviewers and other readers.
The results indicate that the vast majority of hyperedges has weak correlation or similarity between them.

And we specifically noted this example in the Preliminary section.
