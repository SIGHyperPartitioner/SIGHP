## Response 
Q:  
Why were the techniques proposed in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 not validated

Aï¼š  
We clarify that both algorithms achieve the same partitioning quality. Algorithm 2 is to improve the efficiency of Algorithm 1. Theoretically, it reduces the time complexity from O(V^2E) to O(VE). Following your suggestion, we have incorporated the comparison between Algorithms 1 and 2 in terms of efficiency in appendix of our paper, showing the significance of optimizations in terms of efficiency. 

## Reference 
None
## Revision

We conducted ablation experiments to validate the performance of the mentioned optimization measures for efficiency improvement.
