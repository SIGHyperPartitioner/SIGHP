## Response
Q:  
Can the algorithm in Section 3 provide approximation rate or other theoretical guarantees? Why is it superior to existing methods?

A:  
Actually, Pál András Papp has shown the inapproximability of hypergraph partitioning at the 2023 SPAA conference[3]. Hypergraphs present complexities not found in conventional graphs, such as varied hyperedge sizes and higher-order relationships among vertices. This complexity makes it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to get theoretical bounds for hypergraph-related tasks. There is significant evidence of inapproximability in hypergraph contexts, unlike their graph algorithm counterparts which often have clearly established bounds. For instance, S. Sachdeva has proved the inapproximability of Scheduling Problems[1], while Andreas Galanis has shown the inapproximability of the hypergraph coloring problem[2].
